# A living guide to components

There are a ton of ways that you can use components in Ember! This project aims to show short, minimal examples of all of them supported in Ember 3 and the upcoming Octane edition, which is currently in a preview period.

## Why are there so many ways to use components in Ember? 

Each component style has features for addressing different technical and business needs.
The good news is, you don't have to choose just one! You can mix and match styles within the same app, allowing for gradual upgrades.

## Who is this resource for?

Anyone who wants to learn more about components in Ember, or who might teach someone else about them in the future.
